                Hey there! I'm Nazif Ishrak, a computer science student at the University of British Columbia (UBC) in
                Vancouver, Canada. Originally from Dhaka, Bangladesh, my journey to UBC has been filled with incredible
                opportunities and learnings.

                {/* eslint-disable-next-line react/no-unescaped-entities */}
                I've had the chance to work with amazing teams at Broadridge, D-Wave Quantum Systems, and Pathao
                Limited, where I honed my skills in product management, data engineering, and systems analysis. I also
                enjoy teaching and mentoring, having served as a Teaching Assistant at UBC and a Coding Instructor at
                Don Valley West.

                Outside of my professional life, I'm an avid learner and explorer. I love diving into new technologies
                {/* eslint-disable-next-line react/no-unescaped-entities */}
                and methodologies, constantly pushing myself to grow. When I'm not coding or studying, you can find me
                {/* eslint-disable-next-line react/no-unescaped-entities */}
                with friends, eating, or exploring British Columbia's beautiful outdoors.
            </p>

                This website is my personal playground where I don my creative developer hat. While it might look like a
                {/* eslint-disable-next-line react/no-unescaped-entities */}
                simple portfolio with nice aesthetics on the surface, it's much more than that. Behind the scenes, I
                strive to implement community-standard approaches, constantly learning and applying new techniques to
                enhance my skills.

                Thank you for visiting, and I hope you enjoy exploring my work as much as I enjoy creating it.
